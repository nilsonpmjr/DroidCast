# DroidCast Desktop: gap register

This is the short operational view of the project. Read this file first when the
implementation progress is hard to follow. The ticket draft keeps the complete
acceptance criteria; this register says what is usable now and what must happen next.

## Status language

- **Implemented:** code and automated tests exist. Hardware/platform verification
  may still be listed separately.
- **Partial:** a real path exists, but important behavior or proof is missing.
- **Open:** no end-to-end product path exists yet.
- **Blocked:** another named item must be completed first.

An automated fake-process test proves orchestration, validation and failure handling.
It does **not** prove that a phone, camera, codec or operating-system package works.

## Current checkpoint

| Area | Status | What works now | Gap to close |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Bundled runtime | Partial | The forked client, ADB and matching server are launched without executable pickers. | Clean-machine packages, signing and Windows/macOS verification. |
| Session lifecycle | Partial | First-frame state, graceful stop, recording finalization and disconnect/failure states. | Real unplug/reconnect and playable-recording tests on phones. |
| Device workspace | Partial | USB discovery, wireless pair/connect, screenshots, APK install and selected-device targeting. | Complete pair-to-mirror guidance and broader recovery testing. |
| Configuration routes | Partial | Searchable Video, Camera, Audio, Device, Window, Keyboard, Mouse, Gamepad, Recording and Virtual display categories. | Connection/Tunnels, Control, OTG, Video4Linux and complete Shortcuts routes. |
| Toolbar | Partial | Back/Home/Recents, power/volume, screen power, system panels, explicit clipboard copy/paste, Android/window rotation, reset video, mirror-window actions and contextual camera controls. | Live app/file actions and measured FPS. |
| Video | Partial | Codec, bitrate, FPS, size, crop, orientation, guided inspected display/encoder choices, manual fallback and raw report. | Additional codec options, constraint overrides and hardware proof. |
| Audio | Partial | Enablement, source, codec and buffers. | Duplication, encoder/bitrate, require-audio, audio-only and playback policies. |
| Input | Partial | SDK/UHID/disabled keyboard/mouse, key behavior and UHID gamepad. | Mouse bindings, shortcut modifier, AOA modes, gesture help and peripheral tests. |
| Virtual display | Partial | Creation, size/DPI, flex, searchable inspected-app picker, manual package fallback, IME, decorations and close policy. | Android 10+ hardware journeys. |
| Camera | Partial | Source, ID/facing, guided declared size/FPS/high-speed choices, manual fallback, startup torch/zoom and live torch/zoom. | Android-version/capability gates and real camera tests. |
| Recording | Partial | MKV/MP4, rotation, time limit, unique paths and graceful finalization state. | Audio-only/no-playback workflows and playback verification of real files. |
| Embedded video | Open decision | The engine opens a separate native mirror window. | Decide release scope; prototype a real frame inside Qt before promising it. |
| OTG | Open | Nothing end to end. | USB discovery without ADB, control-only session model, drivers and hardware tests. |
| Remote tunnels | Open | Ordinary wireless ADB pairing/connection only. | Consistent remote socket/tunnel configuration across every ADB operation. |
| Linux virtual webcam | Blocked | Upstream feature is known. | Enable V4L2 in the build, detect an existing device, configure it and consume real frames. |
| Distribution | Open | Development staging works on Linux. | Reproducible Linux/Windows/macOS artifacts, notices, Qt deployment, signing and clean-machine QA. |

## Next implementation: measured FPS in the workspace

The clipboard slice is complete in code. The next bounded toolbar slice should turn
scrcpy's existing FPS counter into useful workspace feedback instead of leaving its
measurements only in process output.

1. Add explicit start/stop FPS commands to the bridge without parsing generic logs.
2. Emit bounded structured samples containing rendered FPS and skipped-frame count.
3. Show the latest sample and measurement state beside session status; do not confuse
   rendered FPS with capture limit, display refresh rate or end-to-end latency.
4. Keep measurement host-only and available in read-only sessions, but unavailable
   without video playback or before the first frame.
5. Stop reporting on session end and ignore stale samples from prior session tokens.
6. Test start/stop, structured samples, zero/skipped frames, old engines, timeout,
   read-only mode, camera sessions and layout at 920×680.

## Release-proof still required for recent work

- **Virtual display:** Android 10+ creation, typing, flex resize, app start and close
  policy on hardware, including a phone with no virtual-display launcher.
- **Camera:** Android 12+ front/back selection, recording, high-speed failure/success,
  torch availability and zoom limits. A bridge result currently means “request queued,”
  not “camera hardware confirmed the change.”
- **Android actions:** verify screen power, notification/Quick Settings panels,
  panel collapse, device rotation and reset-video on multiple Android versions.
  Queue acknowledgement does not prove that Android honored the request.
- **Clipboard:** verify copy and paste with empty, Unicode and maximum practical
  content on Android/Linux, Windows and macOS. Automated tests prove command/privacy
  behavior, not platform clipboard interoperability.
- **Cross-platform bridge:** exercise stdin commands and shutdown on Windows; validate
  the app bundle and pipe behavior on macOS.
- **Host branding:** confirm Desktop/Laptop selection on Windows hardware and both
  iMac/MacBook macOS hosts. Linux laptop selection and fallback were reviewed locally.
- **Build toolchain:** GCC 16.2 crashes internally at `-O2`/`-O3`; Release C++
  compilation is capped at `-O1` for GCC 16+. Re-test future GCC releases and remove the workaround
  once the compiler completes the same build reliably.
- **Recording:** open and play finalized MKV/MP4 outputs after normal stop, unplug and
  forced-stop cases.

## How future work updates this file

Every implementation commit should do three things:

1. Move the relevant row only when an end-to-end behavior truly changed.
2. Add remaining manual/hardware proof under “Release-proof still required.”
3. Append technical detail to `implementation-progress.md`; keep this register short
   enough to scan in a few minutes.
